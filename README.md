Project Title: Customer Segmentation & CLV (Customer Lifetime Value) Engine 
Product Brand Name: "Consumer360" 
 
Use Case (Production): 
A major mid-sized e-commerce retailer is suffering from generic, ineffective marketing campaigns. They require a sophisticated data product to instantly identify "High Value" (i.e., 
"Champion") customers for premium engagement and, critically, flag customers who are categorized as "Churn Risks" for targeted retention efforts. The core requirement is that the dashboard must automatically update on a weekly basis, directly pulling from new sales 
transaction data. 
 
Product Features: 
● Basic Core Metrics: Comprehensive tracking of sales trends over time, identification of top-selling products by volume and revenue, and revenue breakdown by geographical 
region. 
● Deep (Production) Analytics: 
    1) RFM Segmentation: Implementing an automated, robust Recency, Frequency, Confidential document and Monetary (RFM) scoring system (typically on a 1-5 scale) for every single 
       customer in the database. 
    2) Cohort Analysis: Advanced visualization of customer retention rates, grouped and tracked based on their initial sign-up or first purchase month. 
    3) Market Basket Analysis: Utilizing Association Rule Mining to uncover nonobvious purchase patterns, such as the classic "People who bought Bread often bought Butter," to inform product placement and recommendation engines.
    
* Data Collection:Take it from Kaggle search for " Retail sales".
* After That do data cleaning in SQL workbench ( duplicates, extra space, null values..).
* After that Calculate Recency using latest invoice date,Frequency using distinct invoice count, Monetary value using total revenue,Create RFM base table at customer      level,Generate monthly sales and product performance data.
* Than export outcomes of all these queries to csv file than add it in python code snippet.
* For mathematical analysis mentioned above do that in python (vs code or in jupyter).
* Than run the python file( i have uploaded file below dashboard and remember to replace youre file in file path).
* Than you will get required files to create final analysis dashboard.
